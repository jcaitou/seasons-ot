Our mission is to help children and youth thrive and become <b>more coordinated, calm, connected, and confident</b>.
</p> <p>
We do this in two ways:<br> <b>1. Direct OT assessment and treatment</b><br> <b>2. Parent coaching and consultation</b> </p> <p>
We pride ourselves on using a family-centered, relationship and play-based approach to address your child's
          individual OT goals. Learning through play has been proven to be most effective for children as it facilitates
          engagement, curiosity, and experiential learning.
</p> <p>
Parent implementation of OT strategies is key to a child's progress and success. We also encourage our clients
          to nurture a growth mindset (parents too) and collaborate with the family to create and achieve meaningful
          goals.
