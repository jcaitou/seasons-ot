      <p class='text-left max-w-3xl m-auto'>
        Our mission is to help children and youth thrive and become <b
          >more coordinated, calm, connected, and confident</b
        >.
      </p>
      <p class='text-left max-w-3xl m-auto'>
        We do this in two ways:<br />
        <b>1. Direct OT assessment and treatment</b><br />
        <b>2. Parent coaching and consultation</b>
      </p>
      <p class='text-left max-w-3xl m-auto'>
        We pride ourselves on using a family-centered, relationship and play-based approach to address your child's
        individual OT goals. Learning through play has been proven to be most effective for children as it facilitates
        engagement, curiosity, and experiential learning.
      </p>
      <p class='text-left max-w-3xl m-auto'>
        Parent implementation of OT strategies is key to a child's progress and success. We also encourage our clients
        to nurture a growth mindset (parents too) and collaborate with the family to create and achieve meaningful
        goals.
